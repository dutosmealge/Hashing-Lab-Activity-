BASIC HASHING AND HASH TABLE

What It Is?
-	This application is a basic console-based password manager built in Java. It uses hashing and a hash table to store and manage user credentials securely. The program demonstrates how hashing ensures data security and how a hash table can efficiently manage key-value pairs.

What It Can Do?
-	The application can:
1.	Add a username-password pair.
2.	Retrieve a password for a specific username (hashed passwords stored).
3.	List all stored usernames.
4.	Exiting

Why did you make that kind of application ?
-	I make this kind of application because the goal was to learn how to implement hashing and hash tables in a real-world scenario. A password manager is a practical example, demonstrating the usefulness of secure data storage and efficient retrieval.

How does it contribute to you or to the community?
-	 This application highlights the importance of secure credential storage. It can inspire developers to use hashing in their projects to protect sensitive information, contributing to a more secure community.
